# QRCoderTestApplication
Testing QRCoder package in C#

  This is only intended to be a starting point for using QRCoder library. Here, I create the bitmap of the QR code image, copy it to the clipboard, and exit the application. Upon exit, you'll be able to paste the QR code image in any application where pasting images is allowed; e.g., ms-paint.

  As suggested in the project page <a href="https://github.com/codebude/QRCoder">codebude/QRCoder</a>, install this package by running the following in the NuGet Package Manager Console:<BR><BR><B><I>Install-Package QRCoder</I></B><BR><BR>
